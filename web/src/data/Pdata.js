          <h3 style={{marginBottom:10, marginTop:20}}>Abstract</h3>
            <p style={{marginBottom:8}}>Neural devices have great potential to advance understanding of neural physiology and enhance neurorehabilitation tools. However, integrating stimulation and recording functions in these devices gives rise to significant challenges due to current limitations in recording devices. Velocity Selective Recording (VSR) offers the potential to solve this using longitudinally spaced electrodes to record action potentials. Despite there being a substantial amount of work on VSR to this point, the optimal configuration of these electrodes and the appropriate sample frequency for accurate results has not been thoroughly researched.</p>

            <p style={{marginBottom:8}}>This study aims to fill that gap by exploring the effects of key setup parameters — Sample Frequency, Inter-Electrode Spacing, and Number of Electrodes — on VSR accuracy and precision. Using a Trans-Membrane Action Potential simulation, the intrinsic velocity spectrum is analysed to understand how each parameter influences the VSR results. The findings indicate all three parameters impact the accuracy of VSR, while precision is primarily influenced by Inter-Electrode Spacing and Number of Electrodes.</p>

            <p style={{marginBottom:8}}>In addition to quantifying these effects, optimisation and modeling techniques are used to determine the optimal setup for future VSR experiments. Among the algorithms compared, Particle Swarm Optimisation and Linear Regression Modeling emerged as the most effective for this purpose. These insights are then applied to real-world data, revealing that while the accuracy can be improved upon, the precision of the real-world data used is superior.</p>

            <p style={{marginBottom:8}}>Ultimately, this work provides a framework from which a longitudinal array of electrodes may be optimised. This offers researchers the opportunity to significantly improve the reliability and efficacy of Velocity Selective Recordings.</p>
